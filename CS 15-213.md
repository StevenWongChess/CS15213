Lecture 1. Overview

lldb for mac is equivalent to gdb for linux

```bash
# Because of overflow
(base) stevenwong@HappyMac LeetCode % lldb
(lldb) print 40000 * 40000
(int) $0 = 1600000000
(lldb) print 50000 * 50000
(int) $1 = -1794967296
(lldb) print (1e20 + -1e20) + 3.14
(double) $2 = 3.1400000000000001
(lldb) print 1e20 + (-1e20 + 3.14)
(double) $3 = 0
```

In C & C++, how memory is allocated for data in struct & no auto boundary check for array.

```c++
for(i = 0; i < 2048; i++)
	for(j = 0; j < 2048; j++)
        	dst[i][j] = src[i][j];
faster than
for(j = 0; j < 2048; j++)
	for(i = 0; i < 2048; i++)
        	dst[i][j] = src[i][j];
```

Intro to the 8 famous labs.



Lecture 2. Bits, Bytes, Integer I

Table of data type representation on different machines

And & Or | Not ~ Xor ^

Bool Type: 0 is false, anything else is true

left&right shift, but shift amount < 0 or >= word size is undefined behavior

logical shift 补0, but arithmetic shift 补最高位(又叫sign extension)

signed and unsigned casting(both implicit and explicit)

Rule is signed will be implicitly CAST to unsigned if there is a mix of them

sizeof will return size_t type which is an unsigned number

truncation(去除最高位会发生甚么)



Lecture 3. Bits, Bytes, Integer II

Lab1 based on lecture 2, 3, 4 (CSAPP Chap 2)

addition: unsigned overflow modular

​				 signed overflow undefined but for most machine is predictable

multiplication: unsigned just truncation

​						   signed overflow undefined

signed power-of-2 divide => need to cope with rounding

~x + 1 == -x

Big Endian(least significant byte has highest address e.g. Internet) & Little Endian(opposite, e.g. on x86, ARM), 用 show_bytes() function

C string: array of char, number 0 with code 0x30, terminate with null(0)



Lecture 4. Floating Point

representation $(-1)^s\times M\times 2^E$, 

normalized: E = exp - Bias, 1.xxxxx

denormalized: exp 部分全0, E = 1 - Bias, 0.xxxxx

special case: exp = 11...11, infinity and NaN

rounding if 0.5, round to the nearest even

mathematical property of FP add: closed under addition, commutative, not associative, 0 is additive identity, almost every element has additive inverse, almost monotonicity (except for infinities & NaNs)

mathematical property of FP mult: closed under multi (but may generate infinity or NaN), commutative, not associative, 1 is multi identity, no multiplication distribute over addition, monotonicity (except for infinity & NaN)

In C, double/float=>int(by truncates fractional part), int=>double(exact), int=>float(lose accuracy)



Lecture 5. Machine-level programing: Basic

architecture(also ISA) => correctness e.g. machine code, assembly code

microarchitecture => performance

no array/ structure in assembly

movq Source, Dest (here operand types are immediate $-533, register %r13, memory &)

这里 %rdi 是参数 x，%rsi 是参数 y，%rdx 是参数 z, %rax 是返回值, 寄存器 %rsp是栈指针，用来记录栈顶的位置

汇编代码中用小括号表示取地址

怎么算address, e.g. (%rdx, %rcx, 4)

addq, subq, imulq, salq(<<), sarq(arithmetic >>), shrq(logical >>),xorq, andq, orq,

leaq (%, %), % address computation

看例子

Procedure: xxx.c=>(thru gcc -Og -S (basic optimization))xxx.s=>(assembler)xxx.o=>binary

binary to assembly, use 

objdump -d xxx



Lecture 6. Machine-level programing: Control

condition codes(CF carry for unsigned, ZF zero, SF sign for signed, OF overflow for signed)

10 kinds of condition code (setX), 配合 ```movzbl``` 食用

如果在编译器中开启 `-O1` 优化，那么会把 While 先翻译成 Do-While，然后再转换成对应的 Goto 版本，因为 Do-While 语句执行起来更快，更符合 CPU 的运算模型。

jumping, 11 kinds of ```jX``` instructions / can be replaced by conditional move to avoid jumping(by computing both branches, but maybe expensive and unsafe)

translate if else, while, for, switch into assembly



Lecture 7. Machine-level programing: Procedure

%rsp points to the current top of the stack

%rbp frame prointer

First six arguments: %rdi, %rsi, %rdx, %rcx, %r8, %r9

pushq, popq

call, ret

本质是把重复使用的东西先放到stack最后再取出



Lecture 8. Machine-level programing: Data

array and pointer

2d-array=>row-major ordering

(two way to represent 2d-array)

Structure: 

	Structure represented as block of memory
	
	Fields ordered according to declaration
	
	Compiler determines overall size + positions of fields

alignment=>structure中每个var起始地址得是size的倍数,且整个structure的起始地址也得是Largest alignment of any element的倍数

array of structure得structure长度的倍数



Lecture 9. Machine-level programing: Advance

How to attack and how to protect



Lecture 10. Code Optimization

O1 optimization

avoid recalculating the same thing

replace costly with simpler(e.g. multiple to shift & add)

share common subexpressions

redundancy removed (e.g. in address calculation)

compiler=>Conservative first



Lecture 11. Memory Hierarchy

SRAM vs DRAM

take use of locality

3 kinds of miss



Lecture 12. Cache

$C = S\times E\times B$

cache read & write

block=>matrix multi



Lecture 13. Linking

1. symbol resolution: global 的declaration, ```objdump -t  ``` 显示symbol table, ```objdump -rd main.o```

Shared object file (.so file)

keyword ```static``` has two meaning: see page 18. One is to limit the scope into this file, another is to be shared by everything calling this function.

strong(procedures and initialized globals) vs weak(uninitialized globals or declared with extern)

multiple strong => link error

strong + weak => choose strong

multiple weak => randomly pick one, see ```gcc –fno-common```

Linker does not do type checking!

2. relocation
3. static library ```.a``` file, e.g. ```ar -t /usr/lib/libc.a | sort```

e.g. ```gcc –static –o prog2c main2.o -L. -lvectorz```

编译命令的技巧：把静态库都放到后面去

4. dynamic linking/ shared library

runtime 也可, ```dlopen()```

[Tutorial: Function Interposition in Linux](http://jayconrod.com/posts/23/tutorial-function-interposition-in-linux)



Lecture 14. ECF_procs

system call: Each x86-64 system call has a unique ID number

e.g. read, write, open, close, stat, fork (*called once but returns twice*), execve, _exit (*called once but never returns*), kill, execve (*Called once and never returns*)

PID = process ID => ```getpid``` ```getppid```

Error-reporting function: ```unix_error```

```bash
# How to make the fork example unpredictable
env LD_PRELOAD=./myfork.so ./fork
```

fork in fork=>draw tree

wait && waitpid



Lecture 15. ECF_sigs



Lecture 16. IO

short counts, e.g. ```write(fd, buf, sizeof(buf)```

file descriptor => io redirection

buffer => strace

last 10 min cover the rest of ECF_sigs



Not important but need to review

Lecture 17. VM_Concepts

Not important, similar to cache

Lecture 18. VM_Systems

page fault x 3



Lecture 19. Malloc_Basic

explicit & implicit allocation

Four kinds: Implicit list, Explicit list, Segregated free list, Blocks sorted by size

Implicit list: First fit, Next fit, Best fit



Lecture 20. Malloc_Advanced

Explicit list = double linked list

Segregated free lists

There kinds: LIFO, FIFO, Address-ordered policy

Garbage collection Implementation

Memory-Related Perils and Pitfalls

C Pointer Declarations: Have fun page. 63



Lecture 21 & 22. Net_Prog (need to be reviewed)

IP, UDP, TCP

DNS:

e.g. ```nslookup localhost```        ```nslookup baidu.com```

Socket address is an **IPaddress:port** pair

Mappings between well-known ports and service names is contained in the file **/etc/services** on each Linux machine.

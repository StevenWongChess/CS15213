This is my own solutions for LEGEND course CS15213. There might be mistakes and pls do not hesitate to contact me if you spot one! For students taking CS15213 @CMU, pls do not copy the code.

There is also a note that records all the notes i take when i watch the lecture videos online.

Lab0 is just a C practice.

Lab1 I skipped the floating point functions and get 44 points only.

Lab2 ONLY finished the first five phases, phase_6 and secret_phase are too long.

Lab3 ONLY finished the first three easy attacks. The key is to translate assembly into machine code and follow little Endian.

Lab5 To make life easier, we can treat read and write as the same thing. Notice that the update of lru is strange. Blocking is too hard.

Notice that if you are running VMware on Mac, you need to cp the shared folder into a local folder on the vm, otherwise wield things will happen.
